# About

This is code for a Chrome extension which scrapes prices on amazon.com search pages and shows an average of the prices in a chrome extension pop up.
The pop up is made in React.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the popup in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
Uses [Craco](https://github.com/dilanx/craco) to modify certain webpack options without ejecting.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run eject`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, and then creates a zip file containing the content of the `build` folder, and saves it to the `extension` folder.
## Test cases

The extension was tested with the following terms:
- Bluetooth headphones
- Digital camera
